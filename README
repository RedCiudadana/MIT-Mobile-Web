The Mobile Web Project was developed during July and August 2009 on top of the original v0.9 release of the MIT Mobile Web project that can still be found on SourceForge. The main thrust of the project is to deliver task-based content like maps, events, and directory information optimized for device "families." The project is focused on delivering a solution for higher education hence the many references to higher education. This project is still under active development.
