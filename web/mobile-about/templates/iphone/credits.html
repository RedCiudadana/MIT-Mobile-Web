		<p>The <?=$inst_name?> Mobile Web was developed using the Mobile Web Open Source Project (OSP). The Mobile Web OSP is based on version 0.9 of MIT Mobile Web. Mobile Web OSP was modified &amp; documented by Dave Olsen of West Virginia University's University Relations/Web Services.</p>
		
		<p>The original MIT Mobile Web was developed by MIT's Information Services &amp; Technology (IS&amp;T) as a service to the MIT community. The initial design and implementation took place in January-May 2008, and after a beta release and testing in May 2008, the site was officially launched in June 2008.</p>
